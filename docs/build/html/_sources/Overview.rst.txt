Why is it important?
--------------------
Current wildfire prediction products aim for giving advanced alerts and predictions to large businesses and fire protection agencies
like Cal Fire and San Diego Gas & Electric. However, access to these tools often require a pricey license so small business owners
don't have the budget and scale to use these tools. Our product pulls publicly available datasets and uses statistical methods for wildfire analysis.


Who is it for? A sample end user.
---------------------------------
Wildfires have caused major problems for businesses located in California. As a storage warehouse rental company owner, I am looking
to expand my locations within California with lower risk of wildfires. They could seriously damage my business and raise my insurance
if I am not careful and planning ahead. If I happen to have a tool for visualizing the hotspots and showing the areas where wildfires
happen less often, it would inform me of the better locations to expand my business.

What information can I get?
---------------------------
The dashboard uses a mix of data visualization and data analysis to give a wide variety of information which can be classfied into
mainly 4 categories

**1. California Incident Map**
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A high level glance at the fires that happened across the state within a specified time frame.

**2. County Incident Map**
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Have a closer look at the county wise distribution of number of incidents in a specified time frame. For better
visual understanding, a pie-chart representing the relative percentage of number of incidents per county is also provided.

**3. County Based Prediction**
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Want to know what are the chances of a fire for a given month in the county of your choosing, head over :ref:`here. <county_based_prediction_marker>`
It uses three different models interactively to come up with the prediction. You can also have a quick look at past trends for the time range
of interest for a specific county.

**4. Geo-Coordinates Based Prediction**
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
While the county wise prediction and past trends is a good insight. If you have a specific location
in mind, and want to know what are the chances of fire, we have that as well.
